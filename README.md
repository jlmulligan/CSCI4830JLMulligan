Repository for Introduction to Software Engineering

I am John Mulligan, a student at the University of Nebraska - Omaha. I prefer to be called 'Jack' rather than 'John.'

The files located in this repository were the ones editted for the web application, 
aside from others editted so that the web framework would work properly. This does
not contain all of the code for the web framework, just the relevant ones.
